      <description>I never really felt it was important to style web pages for the print medium till a few days ago when I was formatting my résumé. The theme that I&amp;rsquo;ve forked to use on this blog employs font-kerning and anti-aliasing to make my posts look like text on paper. This made me curious to see what my resume would look like if printed.
The Print Preview was embarrassing. The text was huge and there were gaps everywhere.</description>
